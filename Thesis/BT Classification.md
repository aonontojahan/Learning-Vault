# Thesis Notes: Brain Tumor Detection

A **thesis** is an extensive research project that demonstrates your understanding and contribution to a particular field of study.

## Thesis Topic: Brain Tumor Detection

### Introduction
Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells in the brain. Early detection and accurate classification are critical for treatment planning and increasing patient survival rates. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used for detecting brain tumors due to its high-resolution imaging of soft tissues.

### Problem Statement
Manual interpretation of MRI scans by radiologists is time-consuming and prone to errors. Automated detection using computer-based methods can improve accuracy and efficiency.

### Objectives
1. To develop an automated system for detecting brain tumors from MRI scans.
2. To classify brain tumors into different types (e.g., Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary).
3. To evaluate the performance of machine learning or deep learning models in tumor detection.

### Methodology
1. **Data Collection** → Obtain MRI datasets from public repositories or hospitals.
2. **Preprocessing** → Noise reduction, normalization, and resizing of images.
3. **Segmentation** → Identify tumor regions using image processing techniques.
4. **Feature Extraction** → Extract features like texture, shape, and intensity.
5. **Classification** → Use ML/DL models (CNN, SVM, etc.) to classify tumor types.
6. **Evaluation** → Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the model.

### Expected Outcomes
- High accuracy brain tumor detection system.
- Reduced manual effort for radiologists.
- A contribution to research in medical image analysis.

### Important Concepts
- **MRI Imaging** → High-resolution images for brain analysis.
- **Machine Learning** → Algorithms to learn patterns from data.
- **Deep Learning** → Neural networks for automated feature learning.
- **Image Segmentation** → Separating tumor from healthy tissue.
- **Evaluation Metrics** → Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
