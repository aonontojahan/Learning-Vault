# Research Notes

**Research** is a systematic investigation to establish facts, discover new information, or develop new theories.

### Types of Research
1. **Basic Research** → Seeks to expand knowledge without immediate practical application.
2. **Applied Research** → Solves practical problems using scientific methods.
3. **Quantitative Research** → Involves numerical data, statistics, and measurable results.
4. **Qualitative Research** → Focuses on understanding concepts, experiences, or social phenomena.

### Steps of Research
1. **Identify the Problem** → Clearly define what you want to study.
2. **Review Literature** → Analyze existing studies and findings.
3. **Formulate Hypothesis** → Make an educated guess or assumption.
4. **Design Research Methodology** → Decide on data collection and analysis methods.
5. **Collect Data** → Conduct experiments, surveys, or observations.
6. **Analyze Data** → Use statistical or thematic analysis to interpret results.
7. **Draw Conclusions** → Summarize findings and their implications.
8. **Report Findings** → Write research papers, reports, or presentations.

### Example
- **Problem**: Effect of sleep on student performance.  
- **Methodology**: Survey students, collect sleep patterns, measure academic results.  
- **Conclusion**: Determine correlation between sleep hours and performance.

### Important Concepts
- **Variables** → Independent, dependent, and controlled variables in research.
- **Sampling** → Choosing a subset of population for study.
- **Ethics in Research** → Ensuring honesty, integrity, and protection of subjects.
- **Literature Review** → Understanding previous research to avoid duplication.
- **Data Analysis Tools** → SPSS, Excel, Python, R for quantitative research.
