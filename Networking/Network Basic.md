# Networking Notes

**Computer Networking** is the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and information.

### Types of Networks
1. **LAN (Local Area Network)** → Covers a small area like a building or office.
2. **WAN (Wide Area Network)** → Covers large geographical areas, e.g., the Internet.
3. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** → Covers a city or campus.
4. **PAN (Personal Area Network)** → Very small network, e.g., Bluetooth devices.

### Network Topologies
- **Bus** → All devices share a single communication line.
- **Star** → All devices connect to a central hub.
- **Ring** → Each device connects to two neighbors forming a ring.
- **Mesh** → Devices are interconnected for redundancy and reliability.
- **Hybrid** → Combination of multiple topologies.

### Network Devices
- **Router** → Directs data between networks.
- **Switch** → Connects devices within a LAN.
- **Hub** → Basic device to connect multiple devices (less used today).
- **Access Point** → Wireless connectivity for devices.
- **Modem** → Converts digital signals to analog for Internet access.

### Protocols
- **TCP/IP** → Foundation of the Internet, reliable data transmission.
- **HTTP/HTTPS** → Protocols for web communication.
- **FTP** → File transfer between devices.
- **SMTP/POP3/IMAP** → Email communication protocols.
